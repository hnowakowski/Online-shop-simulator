# The Drip Shop

## DISCLAIMER

This project was originally made by me and my friend for our OOP classes. Afterwards I have decided to fork the repository and extensively rewrite almost every aspect of the app, so the **vast** majority of the codebase was written by me, but feel free to check the commit history.

## Introduction

This is a desktop app made to simulate the usage of a simple web store. It was created using Qt with C++.

The user is able to:

- sort and filter the display of buyables based on name, price, type, etc
- add various buyables to cart
- purchase said buyables using a wallet or fake card information
- log in and log out of their account
- create a new account

## Running the app

The simplest way to run the app is to open the `shop_project.pro` using Qt Creator and run it there.
You can also compile and run a standalone executable, but it requires the following Qt libraries to be present:

- `Qt6Core.dll`
- `Qt6Gui.dll`
- `Qt6Widgets.dll`

Note: Asset paths are relative and assume the app is run from the build directory in the default Qt Creator project structure.

If setting it up is too much hassle, Iâ€™ve included a video demo of all of the core features:
